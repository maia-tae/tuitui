These are some notes for maintainers.

### Release process

Review and merge PRs into `next` branch. To release a production ready version, you need
to add the commits from `next` to `master` with the following (github web interface does not
work as it makes branches diverge):

```sh
$ git checkout next
$ git pull
$ npm install # make sure any new dependencies are installed
$ npm install --no-save nodegit # needed to test release
$ npm run release -- --dry-run # and check release notes
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
$ git merge --ff-only next
$ git push
```
